## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 16+
- PostgreSQL 13+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gst-billing.git
   cd gst-billing
   ```

2. Install uv (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   # On macOS and Linux
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # On Windows
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

   # Or with pip
   pip install uv
   ```

3. Set up the Python environment with uv
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install dependencies from pyproject.toml
   uv sync

   # Or install in development mode with dev dependencies
   uv sync --editable --extras dev
   ```

4. Set up the database
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Install frontend dependencies
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

6. Build the frontend
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

7. Start the development server
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. Access the application at http://localhost:8000

### Managing Dependencies with uv

The project uses pyproject.toml for dependency management. To add or remove packages:

```bash
# Add a package
uv add <package_name>

# Remove a package
uv remove <package_name>

# Update all dependencies
uv sync

# Generate a lockfile (for reproducible builds)
uv lock
```

## üß™ Running Tests

### Backend Tests
We use pytest for running tests with coverage reporting:

```bash
# Make sure you have the dev dependencies installed
uv sync --editable --extras dev

# Run tests with coverage
python -m pytest billing/tests/ --cov=billing
```

Alternatively, you can use Django's test runner:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

### Continuous Integration
This project uses CircleCI for continuous integration. Every push to the repository triggers a build that runs all the tests with PostgreSQL. You can view the build status in the CircleCI dashboard.
