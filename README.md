## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)
- Docker and Docker Compose

#### Option 2: Manual Setup
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 16+

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gst-billing.git
   cd gst-billing
   ```

#### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Run the development server
   ```bash
   # Make the script executable
   chmod +x run_dev_pip.sh

   # Start the development environment
   ./run_dev_pip.sh
   ```

2. Access the application at http://localhost:8000

3. For production deployment
   ```bash
   # Make the script executable
   chmod +x deploy.sh

   # Start the production environment
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

4. Access the production deployment at http://localhost

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. Install dependencies with pip
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install the project and its dependencies
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Set up the database
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Build the frontend
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Start the development server
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. Access the application at http://localhost:8000

### Managing Dependencies with pip

The project uses pyproject.toml for dependency management. To add or remove packages:

```bash
# Add a package
pip install <package_name>

# Update the project dependencies
pip install -e .

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## üß™ Running Tests

### Backend Tests
We use pytest for running tests with coverage reporting:

```bash
# Make sure you have the dev dependencies installed
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests with coverage
python -m pytest billing/tests/ --cov=billing
```

Alternatively, you can use Django's test runner:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

### Continuous Integration
This project uses CircleCI for continuous integration. Every push to the repository triggers a build that runs all the tests with PostgreSQL. You can view the build status in the CircleCI dashboard.
