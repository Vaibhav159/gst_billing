## Frontend Migration from HTMX to React

### Status: In Progress

### Description
We are migrating the frontend of the GST Billing application from HTMX to React to improve the user experience, performance, and maintainability of the application.

### Current Focus
- Implementing all remaining React pages to achieve feature parity with the current HTMX version
- Optimizing API requests with proper cancellation and error handling
- Ensuring consistent UI/UX across all pages
- Implementing proper data formatting (e.g., Indian currency format)

### Completed Items
- Set up React application structure
- Created core components (Card, Button, FormInput, etc.)
- Implemented main pages (Dashboard, Business, Customer, Invoice)
- Added API client with request cancellation
- Implemented proper error handling
- Added Indian currency formatting
- Fixed invoice detail and print views
- Added reports generation functionality
- Added comprehensive test cases for all API endpoints

### Pending Items
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Optimize performance for large datasets
- Add any missing features from HTMX version
- Phase out HTMX-specific code

### Notes
- Using uv for package installation instead of pip
- Ensuring all price fields display in Indian number format (e.g., â‚¹1,00,000.00)
- Maintaining backward compatibility during the transition
